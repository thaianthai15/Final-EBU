                <p>The first monthly rental payment is charged when ordering, but the rental period does not officially start until you receive your product. The delivery date determines the recurring monthly payment date. If you fall in love and want to keep your product longer than the minimum rental period, you can extend your rental plan in your customer account at any time to reduce the monthly payment. At the end of the minimum rental period, you can keep renting on a monthly basis for the same price or cancel your subscription by returning your device for free.</p>
